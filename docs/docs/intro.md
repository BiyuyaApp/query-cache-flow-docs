# Welcome to CACHE-FLOW

CACHE-FLOW is a **pattern and framework** for managing TanStack Query cache keys in React applications. It provides a structured approach to eliminate manual cache key management and ensures automatic, type-safe cache invalidation.

## The Problem

When building React applications with TanStack Query, developers face several challenges:

1. **Manual cache keys are error-prone** - String-based keys lead to typos and inconsistencies
2. **Cache invalidation is hard** - Knowing which queries to invalidate after mutations is complex
3. **Generated hooks need wrapping** - KUBB-generated hooks lack cache key infrastructure
4. **No standardization** - Every team invents their own patterns

## The CACHE-FLOW Solution

CACHE-FLOW eliminates these problems through a simple philosophy:

```
REST → OpenAPI → KUBB → Autogenerated wrappers → Zero-thought usage
```

With CACHE-FLOW, developers **never think about cache keys**. The framework handles:

- Consistent cache key structure across your application
- Automatic cascade invalidation for mutations
- Type-safe cache operations with full TypeScript support
- Optimistic updates with built-in normalize functions
- Seamless integration with KUBB-generated hooks

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { createQueryGroupCRUD } from 'src/queries';

// Create a complete CRUD query group
const accountsQueryGroup = createQueryGroupCRUD<string>('accounts');

// Wrap KUBB-generated hook with proper cache key
export const useAccounts = () =>
  generatedUseAccounts({
    query: { queryKey: [accountsQueryGroup.list.queryKey] },
  });

// Mutations automatically invalidate related queries
await createAccount.mutateAsync(data);
invalidateQueriesForKeys([accountsQueryGroup.create.invalidates]);
```

That's it. No thinking about cache keys. No manual invalidation logic. Just build features.

## What Makes CACHE-FLOW Different?

CACHE-FLOW is not a package you install. It's a **pattern you copy** into your project and adapt to your needs. The implementation is simple, transparent, and yours to modify.

- **~170 lines of code** - Easy to understand and customize
- **Zero dependencies** - Only requires TanStack Query
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with generics
- **Battle-tested** - Used in production React applications
- **Framework-agnostic** - Works with any REST API pattern
